#  Automated Document Collection and Tracking System
This project automates the process of collecting documents from users via email, tracking submissions, updating records in an Excel workbook, and providing a web-based interface to monitor the status. It combines Excel macros, email automation, file storage, database tracking, and a Flask-based web interface.

**System Architecture**
1. Excel Workbook
Serves as the primary record-keeping tool.

Stores user-specific information such as email addresses, expected documents, and submission status.

2. Macros (VBA)
Automates:

Extracting user details from the Excel workbook.

Sending reminder emails.

Updating the workbook upon file submission.

Reading and writing data within Excel.

3. Email System
Sends automated reminders via VBA or Python.

Monitors inbox for replies with attachments.

Extracts and stores attachments from incoming emails.

4. Users
Receive automated reminders.

Submit required documents by replying to the email with attachments.

5. Attachments
User-submitted documents are stored in an organized directory.

Metadata such as sender, file name, and timestamp is logged for tracking.

6. Database
Logs metadata related to file submissions:

Submitter identity

Document details

Submission time

Supports the web dashboard and document tracking.

7. Python Scripts
Handle backend automation, including:

Email parsing (via IMAP or Outlook integration)

File extraction and storage

Database updates

Excel manipulation (using openpyxl or xlwings)

Optional macro triggering

8. Flask Web Application
Built using Flask (Python framework).

Provides an admin dashboard with features like:

Submission tracking and status indicators (e.g., pending, complete)

File search and download (optional)

Hosted locally or on cloud platforms

9. Webpage
A user-friendly interface for stakeholders to:

View submission statuses in real time

Monitor outstanding and completed uploads
